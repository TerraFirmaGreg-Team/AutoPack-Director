# Pack Director

This is a fork of ModpackDirector (juanmuscaria), which in turn is a fork of FileDirector (TerraFirmaCraft-The-Final-Frontier), which is a fork of mod-director (Janrupf)

Pack Director gives you flexibility in situations
where a mod cannot be packed with your modpack
but can be downloaded at runtime either due to not being present on your target distribution platform,
launcher or copyright issues.
